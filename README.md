# moov\_docs
Automatic Documentation Generator for Moovweb Node Modules

## Quick Start

`npm install` will retrieve moov modules for moov\_docs.

You may like to use `npm link` to reference local versions of your node modules
(which should then be published separately).

`npm run jsdoc` will generate documentations for moov modules. Then index.html
would have access to the docs.
